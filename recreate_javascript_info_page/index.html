          <h2> Javascript Basics </h2>
          <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small nd lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or a Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide a programmaic control over them.
            <ul>
              <li> <u>Variable Declaration:</u> Javascript variabels are containers for strong ata values - imagine a cup you fillth coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable var x;</li>
              <li> <u>Variable Assignmment:</u> Assignment operators assign lues to Javascript variables - our coffee cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable var x=10 </li>
              <li> <u>Data Type:</u> Data types are an important concept to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- true or false; null- null aka nothing; Number- 1,2,3,etc.; String- "Text inside quotes"; Array- ['Index 0','Index 1', 'Index 2']; and Object- {firstName: 'Jane'; lastName: 'Doc'}  </li>
              <li> <u>Conditionals:</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on what values or conditions have been met. You can use condidtional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: IF a specified condition is true, do this in our code block; ELSE IF to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; ELSE we excecute this block of code; </li>
              <li> <u>Loops:</u> There are may different kinds of loops in every programing laguage, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, you run around a track four times then you stop. You looped around the track 4 times!</li>
              <li> <u>Functions:</u> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. Imagine putting together a desk from Ikea. Open up the manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top, next you place the table the right way up. Done! You finished following the instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more tables to to build, so lets call our function over and over again. </li>
